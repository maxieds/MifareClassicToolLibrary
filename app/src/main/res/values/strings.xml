    <string name="aboutAppDesc">This application is an Android demo of the Mifare Classic Tool Library
                                developed by Parklink. The application is written and developed
                                by Maxie D. Schmidt (maxieds@gmail.com) -- https://github.com/maxieds.\n\n
                                Credits for the included stock Mifare Classic 1K dump images go to the Parklink developers,
                                Daniele Bruneo and Simon Yorkston, who have prepared and tested their contents for testing
                                with the application.

    <string name="appHelpContents">
        This application is capable of displaying the contents of a MifareClassic(1K) tag
        dump image, which may be scanned from a live tag with the phone using the
        functionality provided by the MifareClassicTool Library we are demoing here.
        When a new MFC1K dump image is loaded (either from a live tag scan, or from one of the pre-constructed
        stock image files, the meta data for the tag (TAG TYPE, UID, and TAG SIZE specs) is displayed in the
        toolbar at the top of the application. \n\nThe partially dimmed (inactive) icons to the right of this data
        indicate (when turned from dim to full brightness), respectively, (1) that there is an active new tag in range of the
        phone which we may scan and (2) that we are actively scanning for new tags and will process any new tags as we
        encounter them. \n\nThe main sector data display, which shows the block-by-block data contents as hex bytes,
        is color coded using the following colors:\n
        => YELLOW = First block manufacturer data\n
        => BLUE = Access Bits for each block\n
        => RED = KeyA bytes data\n
        => ORANGE = Access Bytes for the sector\n
        => GREEN = KeyB bytes data\n
        => MAGENTA = Higlighted tag differences\n
